# **App Name**: ThreeJS Pathfinder

## Core Features:

- Tech Analysis: AI-powered analysis of a provided article, extracting the core technologies required to build the app's core functionality.
- Scene Display: Display a 3D scene created with ThreeJS.
- Path Creation: Implement a simple path using Catmull-Rom curves in ThreeJS.
- Object Animation: Allow the user to define key points for the path, and a simple 3D object moves smoothly along the generated path.
- Animation Control: Offer a minimal UI to control the animation (start/stop).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#3498DB) for a modern and techy feel.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), close in hue to the primary but almost fully desaturated, to keep focus on the 3D scene.
- Accent color: Orange (#E67E22) to highlight controls and interactive elements.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, will be used for UI elements to maintain a modern and clean aesthetic.
- Use simple, geometric icons for the controls.
- Keep the UI minimal, with the 3D scene taking center stage and the controls docked at the bottom or side.
- Use smooth transitions for UI elements and the object moving along the path.
